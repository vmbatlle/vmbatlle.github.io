abstract:
  "Geometric reconstruction and SLAM with endoscopic images have seen significant advancements in recent years. In most medical specialties, the endoscopes used are monocular, and the algorithms applied are typically extensions of those designed for external environments, resulting in 3D reconstructions up to an unknown scale factor. 
  
  In this paper, we take advantage of the fact that standard endoscopes are equipped with near-light sources positioned at a small but non-zero baseline from the camera. By leveraging the inverse-square law of light decay, we enable, for the first time, monocular reconstructions with accurate metric scale. This paves the way to transform any endoscope into a metric device, which is essential for practical applications such as measuring polyps, stenosis, or the extent of tissue affected by disease."
