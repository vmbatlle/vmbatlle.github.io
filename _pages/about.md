# Hello,

I am a PhD student in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at [Universidad de Zaragoza](https://www.unizar.es), supervised by [Prof. Juan D Tard√≥s](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~jdtardos/). My research interests include Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, [3D Reconstruction](/keywords/#3d-reconstruction), and [Depth estimation](/keywords/#depth-estimation). 

Currently part of the [Robotics, CV & AI Lab](https://ropert.i3a.es), my background includes research positions at Apple in California (2023) and [EPFL in Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) (2024). Previously, I received a BSc in Computer Science (2020) and an MSc in Robotics, Graphics, and Computer Vision (2021), with the highest GPA in the class.
